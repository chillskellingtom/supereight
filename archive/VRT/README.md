# Archived VRT Assets

This directory contains the Video Restoration Transformer (VRT) code and helper scripts that were previously part of this workspace. The main Connor Family Movies pipeline no longer depends on these files.

Contents:
- `VRT/`: upstream VRT model code and assets.
- `scripts/`: helper scripts for VRT usage (model download, Intel GPU patching, GPU run helpers, VRT quality test harness, and Python entry points).

Keep these for historical reference or separate VRT experimentation. Do not reintroduce into the active pipeline without explicit need.
